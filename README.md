## About
Welcome to the repository of **Team sparc-plugins (Team D)** from the **2025 SPARC Codeathon**. 

Learn more about the Codeathon [here](https://sparc.science/help/2025-sparc-fair-codeathon), and meet our team members in the [Team Section](#team) below.

**Note**: No work was done on this project prior to the start of the Codeathon.

## Introduction
The **[NIH Common Fund SPARC program](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc)**(Stimulating Peripheral Activity to Relieve Conditions) aims to advance our understanding of **peripheral nerves**‚Äîthose that connect the brain and spinal cord to the rest of the body‚Äîand how their electrical signals regulate internal organ function. The ultimate goal is to develop **therapeutic devices** that modulate nerve activity to improve organ function and treat conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, and gastrointestinal disorders.

SPARC is a collaborative effort involving **60 research groups across 90 institutions and companies**, working on **over 15 organs and systems in 8 species**.

The **[SPARC Portal](http://sparc.science/)** provides a single user-facing online interface to access resources developed by the SPARC community that can be shared, cited visualised, computed, and used for virtual experimentation. Key features include:
- A **collection of well-curated datasets** in a standardised format, including anatomical and computational. These datasets can be explored under the "[Find Data](https://sparc.science/data?type=dataset)" section of the SPARC Portal, and resources are provided describing how [how to navigate a SPARC dataset](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/navigating-a-sparc-dataset) and [how a dataset is formatted](https://docs.sparc.science/docs/overview-of-sparc-dataset-format).
- **Web tools for exploring SPARC resources** that are directly integrated into the portal, including:
  - Searching datasets with pre-configured filters 
  - Pre-configured data viewers e.g. gallery, image, plot, scaffold, segmentation, simulation, and dataset viewers
  - Viewing anatomical and functional connectivity maps using pre-configured visualisation interfaces

## The problem
Despite its rich offering, the **SPARC portal currently lacks the ability for users to easily**:
- **Perform customised searches** across datasets and knowledge bases
- **Extend or modify existing functionality** such as data viewers or connectivity map visualisations
- **Add new interactive features** such as:
  - Advanced services like image segmentation using state-of-the-art tools
  - Integration of AI chatbots 
- **Access these capabilities during dataset or model development**
- **Enable non-technical users** to contribute or rapidly prototype new features

Implementing any of the above requires expert software engineers familiar with the SPARC codebase. Changes necessitate taking the portal offline, updating the codebase, performing testing and review, and redeploying‚Äîcausing significant disruption to the SPARC community.

## Our solution - sparc-plugins

To address this problem, we have **developed SPARC Plugins (sparc-plugins)**‚Äî
an ecosystem for dynamically integrating rich, interactive features into the SPARC portal in accordance with FAIR principles.

## Supported Features

The **sparc-plugins** ecosystem currently supports the following capabilities:

### üîå Plugin Integration via the SPARC Portal
A dedicated **Plugins Page** on the SPARC Portal where users can **browse and activate plugins**. These plugins have the ability to:
- **Access SPARC datasets and knowledge bases**
- **Reuse, extend or modify existing data viewers and connectivity map visualisations**
- **Link to oSPARC computational services**
- **Integrate rich, interactive content**, such as:
  - 3D visualisations
  - AI-powered chatbots
  - Advanced image segmentation tools
- **Process data to generate new datasets**

### üöÄ Cloud-Based Plugin Development Environment
Offers an **automated and streamlined experience for plugin development, testing, and review** directly on the Plugins Page of the SPARC portal.
**Register and test new plugins** 
- Create new plugins by reusing existing plugin examples
- Plugins can be registered by referencing their code repository 
- Plugins are **automatically integrated** into the portal for testing
- Plugins can be submitted to the SPARC development team for review
- Approved plugins may also be **merged into the main SPARC codebase** for long-term support

### ü§ñ Generative AI Support
Integration of **generative AI tools** to empower **non-technical users** to rapidly prototype and test new plugins directly within the SPARC portal

### üß™ Local Plugin Development Environment
A **container-based development environment** with the following additional features:
- Includes a **local deployment of the SPARC Portal**
- Plugins can be registed by referencing source code stored locally
- Plugins can load locally stored SDS datasets without them needing to be accessible from the SPARC portal
- Enables integration of **external services** via existing APIs or custom backends to test advanced plugin features

[Example plugins](#running-example-plugins) are provided to demonstrate these capabilties.

## Benefits of sparc-plugins

The sparc-plugins ecosystem enhances the SPARC portal by aligning with the FAIR principles and enabling a more dynamic, inclusive, and scalable research environment. This will increase the impact of SPARC community developements.

### üîç Findable

- Encourages modular development using standardized interfaces and containerized environments.

### üîÑ Reusable
- Promotes reuse of SPARC portal viewers and connectivity map visualisations that can be extended and shared across the community.
- Supports automated plugin deployment and versioning for long-term sustainability.

### ‚ö° Rapid Innovation
- Accelerates development and testing of new features without disrupting the main portal.
- Encourages experimentation with advanced technologies like AI, 3D visualization, and segmentation.
  
### üë• Inclusive & Scalable
- Reduces reliance on core engineering teams, enabling broader participation and faster iteration.
- Empowers non-technical users to contribute via generative AI tools.

## Designed to enable FAIRness
We have assessed the FAIRness of our sparc-plugins against the FAIR Principles established for research software. The details of this assemsement is available in the codeathon google drive for team 2.

Additionally, sparc-plugins has adopted exsiting dataset, knoweledge graph and workflow standards including:  
- The Common Workflow Language (CWL) - is an open standard and specification used in the field of bioinformatics and scientific computing to describe and execute tools and workflows. CWL provides a way to define and share complex computational tasks and data processing pipelines in a portable and platform-independent manner. It uses a JSON-based format to describe input data, processing steps, and output data, allowing researchers to collaborate and share reproducible analyses across different computing environments. CWL aims to enhance the ease of defining, sharing, and executing computational workflows, particularly in the context of data-intensive scientific research.
- EDAM ontology - EDAM is a comprehensive ontology of well-established, familiar concepts that are prevalent within bioscientific data analysis and data management (including computational biology, bioinformatics, and bioimage informatics). EDAM includes topics, operations, types of data and data identifiers, and data formats, relevant in data analysis and data management in life sciences.

## Future developments
- Making the sparc-plugin developement environment available directly from within oSPARC.
- Use sparc-flow to store plugins descriptions in a standard tool description language such as the common workflow language, enalbing them to be integrated into simulation workflows.
- Adopt a micro frontend architecture to take modularity provided by sparc-plugins even further‚Äîenabling each plugin or UI module to be developed, deployed, and maintained as an independent application. In addition to existing benefits, this will:
  - Allow users to use different frameworks or technologies for each plugin e.g. Vue, React, Angular.
  - Improve scalability and maintainability by isolating concerns across components.
  - Strengthen alignment with FAIR principles, especially interoperability and reusability, by promoting standardized interfaces and reusable UI modules.
- Demonstrate how SPARC plugins can be integrated into portals on other platforms being developed around the world including the Auckland Bioengineering Institute's 12 Labours DigitalTWINS platform, which is being deployed within New Zealand's  public health system.
<!--*
- Standardise the description of intputs and outputs of these models and tools
- Integrate our knowledge graph with other knowledgebases including the SPARC Anatomical Connectivity Maps and SPARC Functional Connectivity maps. This will enable workflows to be automatically assembled not only based on input/output relationships, but also based on anatomical and physiological connectivity.
- Expand tool descriptions that can be accessed e.g. Workflow Description Language, Nextflow, Snakemake etc 
- Link with Large Language Models to support more complex queries, for example to help visualise quantities of interest.
- Show how the assembled workflows can be run with [sparc-flow](https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/sparc-flow) directly from the commandline or through existing cloud computing platforms from [Dockstore.org](https://dockstore.org) (currently supports running on [AnVIL](https://anvilproject.org), [Cavatica](https://www.cavatica.org), [CGC](https://www.cancergenomicscloud.org), [DNAnexus](https://www.dnanexus.com), [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org), [Nextflow Tower](https://seqera.io/tower), and [Terra].
- Provide API documentation.
