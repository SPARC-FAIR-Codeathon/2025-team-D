# Tutorial 5: Creating and testing plugins using the local development environment

## Summary

This tutorial demonstrates how to create and test plugins using the local development environment. This includes functionality for loading data from locally stored SDS datasets.

Here, we will be using the example of ...
this has a vue based frontend which will be built as an SPARC plugin, and a backend which will be used to load data from locally stored SDS datasets, and run simulation...

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Set up a local development environment for SPARC plugins
- Be able to create a new plugin and test it using the local development environment
- know how to load data from locally stored SDS datasets from a given example

## 1. Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker compose
- 

## 2. Setting up a local development environment

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/2025-team-D.git
```

2. navigate into the repository
```
cd 2025-team-D
```

3. Setting up environment variables

   1. please ask Team D or the SPARC Mentors for the .env file.
   2. put the given .env file in the root folder
   4. launch the local development environment
   ```
   sudo docker compose up
   ```
   
4. After a few minutes, you should be able to access the local instance of the portal at:  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 3. Setting up the plugin's backend server

1. Navigate to ./plugins
3. Get the example plugin and save it in the plugins folder:
4. 
```
git clone https://github.com/Copper3D-brids/plugin-ai-annotator-frontend.git
```

## 4. Loading data from a locally stored SDS dataset

   1. download an example dataset from here
   2. copy into ...

## 5. Registering a local plugin

1. Back to the portal plugin page at [http://localhost:3000/register-plugins](http://localhost:3000/register-plugins)
2. click on "Register a new plugin"
3. Fill in the form and use local path for Source URL. See below:
   - Name: `AI Annotator - YOUR NAME`
   - Source URL: `./plugins/plugin-ai-annotator-frontend`


## 6. Running simulation
