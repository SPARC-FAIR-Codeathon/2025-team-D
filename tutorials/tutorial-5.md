# Tutorial 5: Creating and testing plugins using the local development environment

## Summary

This tutorial demonstrates how to create and test plugins using the local development environment. This includes functionality for loading data from locally stored SDS datasets.

Here, we will be using the example of ...
this [example] has a vue based frontend which will be built as an SPARC plugin, and a backend which will be used to load data from locally stored SDS datasets, and run simulation...

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to:

- Set up a local development environment for SPARC plugins
- Be able to create a new plugin and test it using the local development environment
- know how to load data from locally stored SDS datasets from a given example

## 1. Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker compose
- 

## 2. Setting up a local development environment

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SPARC-FAIR-Codeathon/2025-team-D.git
```
2. navigate into the repository
```
cd 2025-team-D
```
3. Setting up environment variables
   1. please ask Team D or the SPARC Mentors for the .env file.
   2. put the given .env file in the root folder
   4. launch the local development environment
```
sudo docker compose up
```
5. after a few minutes, you should be able to access the local instance of the portal at:  
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 3. Registering a local plugin

## 4. Setting up the plugin's backend server

## 5. Loading data from a locally stored SDS dataset
   1. download an example dataset from here
   2. copy into ...
   3. you can now see it in your local plugin page

## 6. Running simulation
